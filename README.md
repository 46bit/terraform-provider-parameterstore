Terraform Provider
==================

Requirements
------------

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.10+
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.11 (to build the provider plugin)

Building The Provider
---------------------

```sh
$ make build
```

Using the provider
----------------------
If you're building the provider, follow the instructions to [install it as a plugin.](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html#installing-a-plugin) After placing it into your plugins directory,  run `terraform init` to initialize it. Documentation about the provider specific configuration options can be found on the [provider's website](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html).

Developing the Provider
---------------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.11+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

```sh
$ make build
...
```

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

*Note:* Make sure no `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` variables are set, and there's no `[default]` section in the AWS credentials file `~/.aws/credentials`.

```sh
$ make test
```
